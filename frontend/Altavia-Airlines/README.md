## üí° Description

This documentation for the frontend of this project will guide you to make a correct use of the project's website.

## üíº Project guide

In this project the first view we see is the home page, where we can see a *"Book now"* button that will take us to the flights page; as well as the header and footer.

![Home page](./public/docs/homePage.png)

We can see all the flights if we are not logged in.

![Old flight page](./public/docs/flights/oldFlightsPageGuest.png)

But we have to log in to book a flight, so if we try to book a flight it will appear a message:

![Guest try to book a flight error](./public/docs/flights/guestTryToBookError.png)

If we click on "Register" on the header it will take us to the register form where we can enter our information and have access to the website's functionalities.

Once we are registered, we can log in.

### Role user functionalities

Now that we're logged in we can book and cancel flights:

![Book a flight](./public/docs/flights/userBookFlight.png)
![Cancel a flight](./public/docs/flights/userCancelFlight.png)

We also have a page where we can see our bookings; ordered by most recent, future and old bookings:

![Old bookings page](./public/docs/bookings/oldBookingsPage.png)

### Role admin functionalities

In the other hand, if the user logged in has the role *admin* the view will be a little different. Admin can have a detailed view of every flight and the user's that booked that flight.

Admin can also create a new flight with all the necessary data and edit an specific one:

![New flight form page](./public/docs/flights/admin/newFlightAdminPage.png)
![Edit flight form page](./public/docs/flights/admin/editFlightAdminPage.png)

Admin also has a page where a list of all the airplanes availables are displayed.

## üé® Figma design

For this project I designed a Figma project in order to develop my website in a clearer and more orderly way. Here a preview:

## üîó API integration

### üåç Backend's URL configuration

The backend's URL is store in the ***environment*** folder and exported as a JSON constant. This allows easy switching between development and production environments.

```
    export const environment = {
    apiUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api'
    }
```

Like this it can be easily used in the services like this:

```
    private apiUrl = environment.apiUrl;
```

### üîê Authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT)

The authentication system is handled with JWT, and its management is centralized in the **TokenService** and **AuthService**.

- **tokenService:** this service is responsible for storing, retrieving, and deleting the JWT token in localStorage.
- **AuthService:** this service handles login, registration, and logout requests.

### üõ°Ô∏è Route protection with guard

To restrict access to certain routes only to authenticated users, an **AuthGuard** is used to check for token existence.
